# CraftSharp
A Unity package for reading and storing basic data of Minecraft.

## > Development
Unity packages cannot be directly opened as a project in Unity, instead you need to open it as a 'embedded package' inside a project in order to make changes. You can fork the project, and clone the fork into <code>SomeUnityProject/Packages/com.devbobcorn.craftsharp</code>. Then you can open your <code>SomeUnityProject</code> from Unity Hub and find it in Unity's project explorer.

## > Usage
This package provides helper classes and modules for reading and storing basic data types of Minecraft, such as blocks, blockstates, items, and biomes. You can refer to [CornCraft](https://github.com/DevBobcorn/CornCraft) or [CornModel](https://github.com/DevBobcorn/CornModel) to see an example of using this package.
